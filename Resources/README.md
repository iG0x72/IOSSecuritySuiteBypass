## 🧪 Third-party Research Notice

This project is currently being analyzed as part of an independent iOS security research initiative.

The objective of this effort is to:

- Explore the resilience of the publicly documented detection techniques implemented in this library.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak, debugger, emulator, and reverse engineering checks in real-world scenarios.
- Develop custom bypass techniques to better understand potential evasion vectors.
- Provide technical insights that may help improve defensive implementations across the iOS ecosystem.

> 🔍 The research includes static and dynamic analysis of the compiled binaries, runtime hooking evaluation, and Mach-O manipulation under various conditions (e.g., arm64e, Swift symbol interposition, etc.).

This is a respectful, non-commercial initiative intended to contribute to the mobile security community through responsible disclosure, public discussion, and collaboration when appropriate.

> ✅ The intent is **not** to discredit or undermine this valuable project, but rather to support its evolution by highlighting possible areas of improvement and resistance hardening.
